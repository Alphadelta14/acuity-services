As we all know, open source projects are usually written by more than
one developer at a time, and therefore it's required to agree on a
common style what code is supposed to look like.

I shall use an example of code here to get the point across, not
necessarily complete or correct the way it is:
line parseLineInsp(char *data){
    line L;
    char *dataptr;

    L.id = NULL;
    L.command = NULL;
    L.params = NULL;
    L.paramCount = 0;
    L.text = NULL;

    if(!data||!data[0]){
        return L;
    }
    if(data[0] == ':'){
        L.id = data+1;
        while(data[0]!=' ') data++;
        data[0] = '\0';
        data++;
    }
    L.command = data;
    while(data[0]!=' '){
        if(data[0]=='\0')
            return L;
        data++;
    }
    /* Terminate string properly */
    data[0] = '\0';

    /* Shouldn't happen... */
    if(!L)
        aclog(LOG_ERROR, "parseLineInsp: L is broken!\n");
    
    return L;
}

Things to note:
- Spaces are the spawn of Satan:
  - No spaces after anything that is followed by a parenthesis: if,
    while, function calls, etc
  - No spaces in front of opening braces
  - No spaces in front of or after any comparison operator
  - No spaces in front of or after simple || and && conditions (such as
    those that don't require parentheses to be readable)
- /* This is the only sane way to comment. No //. */
- It's okay to leave out a newline for trivial statements for a one-line
  if followup statement (if(moo) return L;).
- Assignments *do* take spaces.
- All braces go to the same line as the statement that requires them
- Always declare the variables you use in the code at the beginning of
  the function, indenting them as if they were normal code.
- One-character variables (L, U, etc.) are required to be uppercase.
- Functions take a space after the comma, in all cases.
Indentation:
- Four spaces per level of indent, this includes one-line if follow-up
  statements, too.
