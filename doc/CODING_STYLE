As we all know, open source projects are usually written by more than
one developer at a time, and therefore it's required to agree on a
common style what code is supposed to look like.

I shall use an example of code here to get the point across, not
necessarily complete or correct the way it is:
line parseLineInsp(char *data){
    line L;
    char *dataptr;
    int paramCount = 0;

    L.id = NULL;
    L.command = NULL;
    L.params = NULL;
    L.paramCount = 0;
    L.text = NULL;

    if(!data||!data[0])
        return L;
    if(data[0] == ':'){
        L.id = data+1;
        while(data[0] != ' ') data++;
        data[0] = '\0';
        data++;
    }
    L.command = data;
    while(data[0] != ' '){
        if(data[0] == '\0') return L;
        data++;
    }
    data[0] = '\0';
    
    dataptr = ++data;
    while((dataptr[0] != ':')||((dataptr[0] == ':')&&(dataptr[-1] != ' ')&&(dataptr[-1] != '\0'))){
        /* include the last space, so that paramCount increases */
        if(dataptr[0] == ' '){
            paramCount++;
        } else if(dataptr[0] == '\0'){
            paramCount++;
            break;
        }
        dataptr++;
    }
    L.paramCount = paramCount;
    if(L.paramCount){
        paramCount = 0;
        L.params = (char**)malloc(sizeof(char*)*L.paramCount);
        L.params[paramCount++] = data;
        while((data[1] != ':')||((data[1] == ':')&&(data[0] != ' ')&&(data[0] != '\0'))){
            if(data[0] == ' '){
                L.params[paramCount++] = data+1;
                data[0] = '\0';
            }else if(data[0] == '\0'){
                return L;
            }
            data++;
        }
    }
    if(data[0] == ' '){
        data[0] = '\0';
        data++;
    }
    if(data[0] == ':')
        L.text = data+1;
    return L;
}

Things to note:
- Spaces are the spawn of Satan:
  - No spaces after anything that is followed by a parenthesis: if,
    while, function calls, etc
  - No spaces in front of opening braces
  - No spaces in front of or after simple || and && conditions (such as
    those that don't require parentheses to be readable)
- Spaces are used when:
  - surround any comparison operator
  - after a function argument
  - around an assignment operator
- /* This is the only sane way to comment. No //. */
- It's okay to leave out a newline for trivial statements for a one-line
  if followup statement (if(moo) return L;).
- All braces go to the same line as the statement that requires them
- Always declare the variables you use in the code at the beginning of
  the function, indenting them as if they were normal code.
- One-character variables (L, U, etc.) are required to be uppercase.
Indentation:
- Four spaces per level of indent, this includes one-line if follow-up
  statements, too.

Naming:
- change* functions are used to keep track of entities internally.
- set* functions change attributes of an entity and sends the change to
  the uplink and calls change* functions to update internal state.
- Modules are to be named after the abbreviated form of their service
  and the command (family) they provide. E.g., NickServ => ns. If more
  than one service start with the same letter, keep going until you
  reach a point without conflict. HelpServ/HostServ: hes and hos.
- Command names should be as self-descriptive as possible.
- Commands which allow overrides through services staff must begin with
  "F." For example, NickServ DROP drops accounts, so the equivalent for
  services staff to override would be FDROP and are to be implemented
  in the same module as the regular command.
- The command callbacks are to have the same name as the module (E.g.,
  ns_drop.c implements NickServ DROP and its callback is ns_drop()).
  The help function is to be called the same as the module, adding
  "help" to it (E.g., help function for NickServ DROP is ns_drophelp)
- Help entries follow ^BCOMMANDNAME ^_param^_ [^_optionalparam^_]^B for
  syntax display.
