# Introduction #

The current implementation status of features will be listed on this page. A feature may be supplied by a module (MOD), by the core (CORE), or unimplemented at the time.

# IRCd support #

Currently only InspIRCd 2.0+ is supported, but there may be more IRCds to be supported later on; patches for new IRCds will be rejected for the time being.

# Platforms #

We aim to have Acuity run on Linux and at least OpenBSD, other BSDs may follow on x86 and x86\_64. Windows will not be supported, and that's considered a feature.
