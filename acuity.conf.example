# Acuity Services: Example configuration file                         #
#######################################################################
# General Syntax:
# VariableName "value"
# 
# Anope users should feel right at home, it's a familiar format. Every
# configuration item will be labelled required or optional and have
# more description to it. Recommended optional values are uncommented.
#
# Recommended values are usually options that make Acuity behave sane,
# but could need to be changed in some scenarios like small private
# networks.
#
# Throughout the example configuration file, we'll assume a fictional
# network "neo-hydra network" on irc.neo-hydra.invalid for examples.
#######################################################################
# ServerName: required
# Specifies the server name for services to identify themselves with.
# You'll need to specify this in your IRCd's link block or equivalent.
# Remember to allow this server to act as a hub IRCd-side if you intend
# to use services to jupe servers.
ServerName "services.neo-hydra.invalid"

# ServerDesc: required
# Specifies the server description. This is only shown in /WHOIS output
# and some other places, mostly for vanity. You're welcome to put a
# witty slogan here.
ServerDesc "neo-hydra network services"

# ServerId: required
# The server id is required in server-to-server linking. InspIRCd and
# TS6 IRCds use this format: [0-9][0-9A-Z][0-9A-Z]

# in length.
NickServMinPasslen "6"
