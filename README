Description
-----------
Acuity is (yet another) IRC services package, with the goal of being
light on resources, stable, and providing features that apparently
nobody else thought of or doesn't want to implement.

Currently, there's not much to see. The services don't write to a
database quite yet, but an SQLite backend is planned. Passwords will
always be encrypted for the users' own good.

Dependencies
------------
Acuity currently doesn't depend on any special external libraries.
gmake (GNU make) is required for the build process, and the code was
only compiled on gcc; there is no guarantee it will work with any other
C compiler available.

Installation
------------
$ make
$ make mod
$ cp acuity.conf.example acuity.conf
$ $EDITOR acuity.conf

NOTE: BSD users have to edit the Makefile due to portability issues.

The configuration contains explanatory comments, so it should be
possible to get things done easily enough.

Usage
-----
./acuity {start|stop|rehash}

Self-explanatory, I would say.

License
-------
See LICENSE, but if you can't be bothered to look it up, Acuity is
licensed under the MIT license.
